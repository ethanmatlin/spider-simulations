set locations for all J spiders 
initialize Fitness to 0 for all J spiders
initialize size to 1 for all J spiders
set number at location to 0 for all locations
then count the number at each location and set that

for t to T {
	either draw a new arrival rate or not 
	set the u matrix to a rnadom poisson draw 
	loop through spiders j to J {
		if alive {
			calculate fitness based on where they are/food available
			set size based on fitness panel
		if dead {
			set size, loction, and fitness to negatives/zero
		}
		}
	}
	rescale size from continuous to discrete
	loop through spiders j to J {
		check if dead
		calculate fitness of all possible locations
		move to optimal location dependent on how rational/omnicient 
	}
	count the number at each location
}


1. average over multiple time steps teh fitness functin so not moving so much
2. move one spider at a time instead of all at once
3. give different patches different arrival rates
